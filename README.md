# Cloud-Formation

## Overview
This repository contains AWS CloudFormation templates used for Infrastructure as Code (IAC) to automate and maintain the state of AWS infrastructure. CloudFormation allows you to describe your AWS infrastructure as code, enabling you to provision and manage AWS resources in a predictable and scalable manner.

## Features
- Infrastructure as Code (IAC) specific to AWS.
- Automates provisioning and management of AWS resources.
- Maintains infrastructure state to ensure consistency.
- Supports both YAML and JSON templates.
- CloudFormation reads templates as inputs to describe the desired state of the infrastructure.

## Terminology
- **Templates**: Text files written in either YAML or JSON format that define the AWS resources and their configurations.
- **CloudFormation**: AWS service that allows you to create and manage a collection of AWS resources as a single unit called a stack.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IAC)**: Practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through code rather than manual processes.
- **State of Infrastructure**: Refers to the current configuration and status of AWS resources managed by CloudFormation.
  
## Tools
- **AWS CloudFormation**: Service provided by AWS to model and provision AWS resources.
- **AWS StackSets**: AWS service that enables you to provision a common set of AWS resources across multiple AWS accounts and regions.

## Usage
To use these CloudFormation templates:
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Choose the appropriate template (YAML or JSON) for your AWS infrastructure.
3. Modify the template according to your requirements.
4. Use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs to deploy the template to your AWS account.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or want to improve the templates, feel free to submit a pull request.
